# The Battle Simulator
This project was created at the end of Grade 12 as a final culmination project for the material learned in Grade 12. I also took this as a personal project as I tried to apply some of my own self-taught knowledge in this game. I'm always looking to improve it.

#### What is it?
*The Battle Simulator* is a Pokemon themed game. It's not so much an actual battle simulator, but more like a horizontal shooter game that uses the formulas from the official games. There are a total of 6 levels in the game, with each one becoming more difficult. All games played feature a randomly selected team, so no two games are alike. 

The `scores.txt` file keeps a scorebaord of the top 10 games played.
The `Previous Battle.txt` records the set team from the previous game played.
